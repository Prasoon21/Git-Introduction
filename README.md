## Git Installation

Git installation is pretty straight forward.

__On Windows__

You just have to download the installer from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/ "git-scm.com"), and then run it, thats it. Git will be installed.

__On Mac OS__

If you have XCode installed on your MAC then you do not need to do anything, git will already be there, if not then you have to just run command "__git version__" in your terminal and MAC will prompt you to install either XCode or command line developer tools, you can choose to install just command line tools if you dont want to install XCode.
